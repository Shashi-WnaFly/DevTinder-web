            Devtinder is a developer version of Tinder, location-based social
            discovery and dating app that allows users to connect with new
            people by swiping right to like or left to dislike profiles. If two
            users mutually like each other's profiles, it's a match, and they
            can begin chatting and arranging to meet in real life. Users can
            create profiles with photos and descriptions, find people with
            similar interests, and find friends, dates, or relationships.
