          </h1>
          <p>
            You can request to delete your TinderDev Account anytime. Before you
            proceed with the account deletion process, please read and fully
            understand the terms related to account deletion. If you do not
            agree with the terms, please stop the deletion process immediately.
          </p>
          <h3 className="my-4 text-lg font-semibold text-black">
            About deleting your TinderDev account:
          </h3>
          <p>
            1. Once you request to delete your TinderDev account, you will enter
            a 15-day cool-off period during which we will preserve your data but
            it will not be visible to other users. You can retrieve your account
            anytime by logging back into TinderDev within the cool-off period.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. If an account is permanently deleted after the cool-off period,
            such deletion is irreversible, and you will not regain access. All
            third-party accounts connected to this deleted account will be
            automatically disconnected, and you will not be able to log in with
            these third-party accounts.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Upon deletion, you will lose access to all content, including
            information, data, and records associated with your account. You
            will lose access to all subscriptions and or/content you purchased
            with that account. You will not be able to recover or request to
            retrieve any account-related content or information, even if you
            register and use TinderDev again with the same user name or email
            address.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Some content, such as comments or posts you made in the
            community, may remain visible to other users after your account
            deletion, but this information will be displayed anonymously.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. Once you agree to delete, the relevant terms of service and other
            rights with TinderDev will terminate accordingly, except for those
            that have been agreed to continue in effective or as otherwise
            prescribed by laws and regulations. You will also no longer enjoy
            the user rights outlined in the "Privacy Policy," except as
            otherwise mandated by laws and regulations or required by regulatory
            authorities.
